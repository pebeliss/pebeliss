### Hello and welcome to my Github profile!

My name is Elissa and I'm currently a M.Sc. student in Life Science Technologies at Aalto University.\
I'm a curious-minded problem solver who is enthusiastic about statistics, data science and machine learning,\
especially when they can be utilized in solving problems related to healthcare and biological phenomena.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Some of my most recently encountered (and/or highly interesting) course topics include:
- Modelling gene regulation networks and chemical reactions using ODEs
- Advanced (Bayesian) probabilistic methods in ML
- Multivariate statistics: PCA in dimension reduction and outlier detection
- MCMC, HMC, Metropolis(-Hastings) and other stochastic simulation methods
<br>
<br>
<br>
Github is still quite new to me and I'm only on my way to discovering all the secrects it has to offer.\
However, I'm not in a hurry and I'm going to enjoy the journey to the unravelment. ðŸ˜„
