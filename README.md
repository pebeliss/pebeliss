### Hello and welcome to my Github profile!

My name is Elissa and I'm currently a MSc student in Life Science Technologies at Aalto University.\
I'm a curious-minded problem solver who is enthusiastic about statistics, data science and machine learning,\
especially when they can be utilized in solving problems related to healthcare and biological phenomena.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Some of my most recently encountered (and highly interesting) course topics include:
- Modelling gene regulation networks and chemical reactions using ODEs
- Bayesian networks in ML
- Multivariate statistics: PCA in dimension reduction and outlier detection

In the upcoming months I'll try to bring my profile up to date to contain the most recent course work and projects.

<br>
<br>
Github is still quite new to me and I'm only on my way to discovering all the secrects it has to offer.\
However, I'm not in a hurry and I'm going to enjoy the journey to the unravelment. ðŸ˜„
