## Hello and welcome to my Github profile!

My name is Elissa and I'm a recent MSc (Tech) graduate from Aalto University specialized in ML, AI and data science.

Beyond that I'm a curious-minded problem-solver, with a passion towards technology and solving analytically challenging problems. Difficult and complex subjects give me fuel and drive rather than petrify! On my free-time I enjoy socialising, variety of sports, painting, singing, making music and designing clothes. üé®üé∂üëó
